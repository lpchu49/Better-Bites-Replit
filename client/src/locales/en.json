We craved something real - food that was honest as it was delicious, the kind of simple, recognizable ingredients our parents and grandparents used in their own kitchens.",
    "originP2": "That’s where the idea for Better Bites took root. Snacks made with honesty, transparency and integrity, without compromising on taste. We began in a small kitchen, using dates as natural sweetener, adding almonds, cashews and walnuts for natural crunch and nutrition. Coconut, cacao, and matcha brought depth and variety. No cooking required, just raw ingredients blended together with care. ",
