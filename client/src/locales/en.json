    "originP2": "We were tired of reading labels packed with artificial sweeteners, preservatives, and mystery additives. We craved something real — a snack that was as honest as it was delicious.",
    "originP3": "So we started experimenting. Dates became our natural sweetener. Almonds, cashews, and walnuts added crunch and nutrition. Coconut, cacao, and matcha brought flavor and variety. No cooking required — just pure, raw ingredients blended together with care.",
    "missionTitle": "Our Mission",
    "missionText": "To create clean, wholesome, and real snacks that make you feel good. We're here to prove that healthy eating doesn't mean sacrificing taste — and that transparency in ingredients should be the norm, not the exception.",
